My name is Jaden Arceneaux. I'm a self-taught programmer based in Las Vegas, Nevada. I currently work as a full-stack web developer. I've been programming since I was 13 and I've been on GitHub since I was 14 (2019). This account showcases showcases highlights of my work, from my very first Python project to now.

Although I am currently employed I absolutely love working on open-sourced projects. Feel free to check out some of my projects listed below or reach out to me if you want help with yours. My email is <a mailto="contact@jadenarceneaux.com">contact@jadenarceneaux.com</a> and my personal website is <a href="https://jadenarceneaux.com">https://jadenarceneaux.com</a>



Much love ❤️
