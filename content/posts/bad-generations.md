I know I could probably Google this and find a million sources describing what I'm thinking about. But where's the fun in that?

## Why are boomers like that

For a generation that started as one of the most progressive and communal they sure have... deviated from that.

In truth, I think it lies in something simple. Self-preservation and a generational bias towards it. Unfortunately, as the saying goes "the good die young". Often, the only people left to represent a generation into its elder years are the ones who prioritized self-preservation above all else throughout their lives. Without that goal, they likely wouldn't have lived that long. There is a direct negative correlation between the good people in a generation and the amount of time that generation has been on earth.

## My take

Honestly, that kinda sucks. Just knowing that the only examples of my generation left to represent us will be those who prioritized themselves above all else. 

I wonder how long it'll take before this generational bias sets in on Gen X and Millennials. When the only evidence of them is their worst offerings walking among us.

I wonder what my generation will be held accountable for by future kids and young adults.
