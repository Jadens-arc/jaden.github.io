## Introduction
I take a lot of pictures, and I mean a lottt of pictures. If you've read my past blog posts you'd know that. I want to be able to remember such a critical part of my life. I want to be remembered. And I want to capture these memories in as much detail as I can. In a strange twist, it is difficult at times to live in the moment without thinking about how this moment will be remembered. So the topic of data storage is very near and dear to my heart. Three things in particular contributed to me deciding to write about this. 

The first was me being very nosy and Googling one of my neighbors (I really hope they don't read this). I ended up finding their MySpace account. When I looked at it on my phone I could see very low-resolution images. When I tried to view it on my computer, the images wouldn't load at all. This lead me down a rabbit hole to try to uncover the source of this strange behavior. I ended up learning that in 2019 MySpace lost all content published before 2016. The cause of such a massive data loss? Not a massive geographical catastrophe, not Russian hackers, not even a Chinese dancing app. It was a failed server migration. Simple user error on the part of the backend developers.

The second one was an evening I spent with my mom. We were trying to find a very important tax email in her AOL inbox but instead i ended up coming to the horrifying realization that her whole financial life hung in the balance of a company barely staying alive. A former tech giant deemed "too big to fail".

The final nail in the coffin was a conversation with a friend. I was trying to tell him how crazy it is that we might end up being one of the least documented generations and he looked at me like I was crazy. He said something to the effect of "no way, with the amount of pictures and videos people take these days, we're going to be one of the most documented generations". He is very smart too so this took me aback and made me second guess myself. 

I think everyone wants to be remembered. They say a person dies twice; once when their heart beats for the last time and the second time when their name is spoken for the last time. So many people live under the falsehood that due to the fact our lives are so heavily documented through social media and our online presence, we'll all be remembered forever. To the point that people feel overly comfortable with the idea of not having anything physical to leave behind. But there is a difference between being captured and being remembered. The adage goes "the internet is forever", but things in the real world are rarely ever that simple. In truth, the internet is only as permanent as it is profitable and data is only as good as the medium it is stored on. 


## Some Background
I assume everyone reading this is at least somewhat tech-savvy, but just in case I think I should go over some basics. 

**The cloud is just someone else's computer**. When ever you upload anything to anywhere it doesn't just go into the ether, it goes into another computer somewhere else into the world. While it might be a big computer, maintaining by highly skilled people, it is nonetheless just a computer. The same in principle as the one in your pocket. Just as your phone slows down over time and slowly degrades, so to happens to servers accross the world. 

**There is no perfect way to store information**. Just as a piece of paper slowly degrades as you write and erase on it, the same fate dooms hard drives, solid state drives, and every other form of data storage known to man.
