## Introduction
I take a lot of pictures, and I mean a lottt of pictures. If you've read my past blog posts you'd know that. I want to be able to remember such a critical part of my life. I want to be remembered. And I want to capture these memories in as much detail as I can. Three things contributed to me thinking about this. The first was me being nosy and Googling one of my neighbors (I really hope they don't read this). I ended up finding their MySpace account. When I looked at it on my phone I could see very low-resolution images. When I tried to view it on my computer, the images wouldn't load at all. This lead me down a rabbit hole to try to uncover the source of this strange behavior. I ended up learning that in 2019 MySpace lost all content published before 2016. The cause of such a massive data loss? Not a massive geographical catastrophe, not Russian hackers, not even a Chinese dancing app. It was a failed server migration. Simple user error on the part of the backend developers. 

The second one was an evening I spent with my mom trying to find a very important email in her AOL inbox and coming to the horrifying realization that her whole life hung in the balance of a company barely staying alive. A former tech giant deemed "too big to fail".

The final nail in the coffin was a friend. I was trying to tell him how crazy it is that we might end up being one of the least documented generations. 

I think everyone wants to be remembered. They say a person dies twice; once when their heart beats for the last time and the second time when their name is spoken for the last time. So many people live under the falsehood that due to the fact our lives are so heavily documented through social media and our online presence, we'll all be remembered forever. To the point that people feel overly comfortable with the idea of not having anything physical to leave behind. As the adage goes "the internet is forever". But things in the real world are rarely ever that simple. 


I assume everyone reading this is at least somewhat tech-savvy but just in case I think I should go over some basics
