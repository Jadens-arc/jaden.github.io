The shallow answer is a social media platform written in PHP using the Symfony framwork. It's hosted on using the Google Cloud Platform in a single VM instance. The production database is MariaDB.

But that still leaves the question of why it exists? 

I made it with the intent of having a place to publish my music reviews and allow other people publish whatever else they wanted to write. By far I'm the most active on my instagram which isn't convient for posting large blocks of text but by having Opium.press I am able to share a single link

When I started planning out Opium.press I realized there were a lot of issues with other platforms that I felt like I could address.

The biggest of them being addiction. I wanted to see what would happen if you made a platform that was designed to be the least addicting.

That influenced every decision that I made throughout the project.

The monochromatic color scheme and lack of photo or video is designed to limit visual stimulation while still being effective at communicating information.
