## Personal

I don't really plan these projects in advance. Most of them start out as small ideas and grow into something bigger than I could imagine. The newer ones are 1000x better than the older ones but they're all my babies. I love all of them equally.

- **[Ironmind](https://github.com/jadens-arc/Ironmind)** - 2024
    - Esoteric Language interpreter and code execution visualizer.
    - Written in Rust and available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/ironmind), [snap](https://snapcraft.io/ironmind), and [homebrew](https://github.com/Jadens-arc/Ironmind?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew)
    - Currently at 7,000+ downloads :D
    - This started as a joke. It was just me wanting to dip my toes into the world of ownership-model memory management and Rust as a whole. I ended up making something that is pretty robust and something I'm proud of.
- **[Opium.press](https://github.com/jadens-arc/opium.press)** - 2022-23
    - A platform for writers to share ideas and opinions
    - Written in PHP using the Symfony framework
    - Hosted on Google Cloud
    - Made shortly after I graduated high school. My hobby of journaling turned into a full obsession with writing. It started off with me writing one-off album reviews when I was in class but evolved into me wanting to share them with the world. I wanted to make a platform for writers, that didn't focus on viewer retention and addiction. There's a lot more lore to this one [you can read it here](/posts/what-is-opium-press/)
- **[Penny](https://github.com/jadens-arc/Penny)** - 2021-22
    - AES256 encrypted journaling desktop app
    - Written in Javascript using Electron
    - During the pandemic, I got super into journaling but I always had a fear of someone reading my journal. This was the solution. This was also around the same time I started taking data privacy seriously and built my first Linux desktop machine.
- **[Scripty](https://github.com/jadens-arc/Scripty)** - 2019-20
    - Simple text editor with support for Python, Javascript, and Java
    - Written in Python
    - I made this because my first computer was a Chromebook that I promptly installed Linux on when I was a freshman in high school. There's even an old [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/87He3poTdNM?si=3rm7X3KnaCigl2k9) I made from around that time explaining how to install Linux on a Chromebook. Because of the hardware limitations, my only option for writing code was using Nano or Vim. Scripty was a huge step up from that. Yes, parts of Scripty were written using itself.

## Professional

My focus throughout my professional life has been enterprise software. It has a certain charm to it.
