      <description>Just got this thing set up. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie it was kinda a pain in the ass. That&amp;rsquo;s mostly my fault though because of how I approached things. I saw this theme and I really liked it so I wanted to use it. The only problem is my only experience with GitHub pages was from years ago and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it. Revisiting it after so long was&amp;hellip; jarring to say the least and adjusting to new deploy tools like Hugo was surely something.</description>
