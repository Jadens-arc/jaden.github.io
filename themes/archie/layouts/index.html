        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I've been working at ISP.Net/LV.Net for over 2 years now as a Full
          Stack Developer. I primarily work in PHP with the Symfony framework.
          Working at an internet service provider has given me the unique
          opportunity to not only grow as a developer building enterprise
          software, but to also learn about how some of the most critical
          infrastructure is managed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of that programming as been my passion for a big part of my
          life. I taught myself my first programming language at 13 and
          instantly became addicted. There hasn't been a single day since where
          I have worked on something.
